            <p>Maybe it's that voice saying "this chord progression is too predictable." Maybe it's the 47th revision that somehow sounds worse than the first. Maybe it's that gnawing feeling that you're running out of time to make something that matters.</p>

            <p>Here's what no YouTube tutorial will tell you: Your technical skills aren't the issue. Your ideas aren't the problem.</p>
            <p><strong>The problem is the gap between what you hear in your head and what comes out in the room.</strong></p>
            <p>That gap fills with doubt. With overthinking. With the weight of every song you've ever loved and every fear that yours won't measure up.</p>
            <p>I spent years in that gap myself—obsessing over snare sounds for three hours while the song itself begged to just exist. Letting my OCD convince me that one more revision would finally make it "right." Writing and rewriting the same verse until I couldn't even remember why I loved the idea in the first place.</p>

            <p><strong>The artists who finish aren't the ones who know more. They're the ones who've learned to trust their instincts while having someone skilled enough to guide them through the paralysis.</strong></p>
