            <p>You've got journals full of lyrics. Voice memos scattered across your phone. And a folder full of demos that keeps growing. So why is finishing (or feeling good about) your song still so hard?</p>
            <p>Maybe it's that voice saying "this chord progression is too predictable." Maybe it's the 47th revision that somehow sounds worse than the first. Maybe it's that gnawing feeling that you're running out of time to make something that matters.</p>

            <h2>The Gap Between Vision and Reality</h2>
            <p>Pretty much every songwriter has experienced this. The gap between what you hear in your head and what comes out in the room.</p>
            <p>That gap fills with doubt. With overthinking. With the weight of every song you've ever loved and every fear that yours won't measure up.</p>
            <p>I spent years in that gap myself—obsessing over snare sounds for three hours while the song itself barely existed yet. Letting my perfectionism convince me that one more revision would finally make it "right." Writing and rewriting the same verse until I couldn't even remember what I liked about the idea in the first place. Then I learned something that changed how I approach every session.</p>

            <p>The prolific artists aren't the ones who know more. They're the ones who trust their instincts—and have someone skilled enough to help them see past their blocks.</p>

            <h2>Here's How It Works</h2>
            <p>For 60 focused minutes, we work on whatever's actually stopping you from finishing. Bring your works in progress—rough demos or nearly-done tracks. I'll listen with the ears of someone who's:</p>
            <div class="benefits">
                <ul>
                    <li>Produced tracks with millions of streams</li>
                    <li>Toured internationally with major label artists</li>
                    <li>Overcome the same perfectionism that's stopping you</li>
                    <li>Helped artists go from 30 unfinished demos to completed albums</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>We'll identify exactly what's blocking you—maybe it's a chorus that won't come, a production decision you're struggling with, or a deeper fear of being truly seen.</p>
            <p>But we won't stop at identifying problems. We'll map out your exact next steps.</p>
