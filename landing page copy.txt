I Know Why Your Best Songs Stay Trapped in Voice Memos and Half-Done Sessions.

Get the outside perspective and clear next steps you need to finally finish what you've started—without losing what makes it yours. For songwriters and self-producing artists. 

You've got journals full of lyrics. Voice memos scattered across your phone. And a folder full of demos that keeps growing. So why is finishing (or feeling good about) your song still so hard?

Maybe it's that voice saying "this chord progression is too predictable." Maybe it's the 47th revision that somehow sounds worse than the first. Maybe it's that gnawing feeling that you're running out of time to make something that matters.

***I get it.*** **Because I've been exactly where you are.**

The Gap Between Vision and Reality
Pretty much every songwriter has experienced this. The gap between what you hear in your head and what comes out in the room.
That gap fills with doubt. With overthinking. With the weight of every song you've ever loved and the fear that yours won't measure up.
I spent years in that gap myself—obsessing over snare sounds for three hours while the song itself barely existed yet. Letting my perfectionism convince me that one more revision would finally make it "right." Writing and rewriting the same verse until I couldn't even remember what I liked about the idea in the first place. Then I learned something that changed how I approach every session.

What Changes Everything
After years of producing records, touring internationally as a Musical Director, and watching artists at every level work through the same struggles, one thing became clear:
The prolific artists aren't the ones who know more. They're the ones who trust their instincts—and have someone skilled enough to help them see past their blocks.
That's exactly what the Song Deep Dive provides.

Here's How It Works
For 60 focused minutes, we work on whatever's actually stopping you from finishing. Bring your works in progress—rough demos or nearly-done tracks. I'll listen with the ears of someone who's:

Produced tracks with millions of streams
Toured internationally with major label artists
Overcome the same perfectionism that's stopping you
Helped artists go from 30 unfinished demos to completed albums

We'll identify exactly what's blocking you—maybe it's a chorus that won't come, a production decision you're struggling with, or a deeper fear of being truly seen.
But we won't stop at identifying problems. We'll map out your exact next steps.

What You'll Walk Away With
Within 24 hours of our call:

Your recorded session (lifetime access) to revisit every insight
A personalized Action Plan detailing your next steps—specific, practical, achievable
The Songwriters Companion Notion template—my personal system for organizing ideas and finishing songs
Home Recording Guide for capturing professional vocals and guitars in your space
$200 credit toward full production (valid 30 days)

But more than that, you'll leave with clarity. With momentum. With the confidence that comes from having someone who truly understands both the technical and emotional landscape of your creative process.
This Is For You If:

You have real songs that deserve to be finished
You're tired of the endless loop of revision without resolution
You want honest feedback from someone who respects your vision
You're ready to move from paralysis to completion

This Isn't For You If:

You're looking for shortcuts to "viral hits"
You want someone to write your songs for you
You're not ready to be vulnerable and honest about your work
You've never written songs before and want to see what it's like

Let's Be Honest
You can keep wrestling with the same doubts, the same circular revisions, the same crisis of confidence every time you work on your songs.
Or you could spend one hour getting the clarity, direction, and momentum you need to finally finish what you've started.

FAQ
Do I need a polished demo to book a call?
Nope. Voice memo, rough demo, nearly-finished track—wherever you're stuck, we start there.
What if I want ongoing support?
This call is a powerful standalone reset. If you want to explore production or longer-term collaboration, we can discuss options that make sense for your project.
What happens after I book?
You'll pick your time slot and send me your tracks. I'll listen in advance so we dive straight into solutions, not setup.
I'm a producer who struggles with lyrics. Is this for me?
Absolutely. We'll work on practical lyric-writing methods you can use immediately—whether for your own songs or co-writes.
Do you take songwriting credit or royalties?
No. This is about empowering YOU. Any suggestions I make are yours to use (or ignore) as you see fit. No splits, writing credits or royalties.
Can I reschedule if something comes up?
Yes. You can reschedule up to 24 hours before your session.
